== Step 2. API
Now, let's go into how the bill is actually created.

Assume there is a `main` entry point function into your application. Your next task is
to show the flow of function calls from that main method, so that the bill has been
generated by the end of it.

_For simplicity, at this point, just consider a single bill, say, for one month._

[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args){
  // TODO: create bill
}

TIP: This part is about picking good names for the "working parts" of your code. By
writing the functions (and therefore the relations) between the different objects, you
will probably spot some names can be improved. Refactor!
