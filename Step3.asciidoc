== Step 3. Let's Spice Things up a Little
In addition, you can consider the following common modifiers to the above items, just to
spice things up a bit:

* pre-pay customers!
** _So far, we have been assuming a post-pay customer, with a monthly
bill, but in some countries pre-pay customers comprise 80-90% of total users!_
** Does your model support them?
** Do the names that you've picked cover this case?
* Usage during "peak" hours vs. off-peak (e.g. evenings & weekends),
* Calls, etc. made to the same network vs. cross-network,
* Usage included in monthly plan vs. extra usage
